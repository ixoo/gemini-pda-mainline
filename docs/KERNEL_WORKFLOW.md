# Pinned stable-kernel patch workflow

This repository stores an ordered patch series and the inputs needed to apply it
to a verified stable Linux release. It does not store a Linux source tree or
build outputs.

## One-command build

From macOS:

```sh
./scripts/dev-vm build-kernel
```

That command performs the complete workflow inside the ARM64 development VM:

1. reads `kernel/manifest.json`;
2. downloads the pinned kernel.org tarball into the guest cache;
3. verifies its SHA-256 before extraction;
4. creates a managed source tree on the guest ext4 filesystem;
5. applies every patch named in `patches/series`, in order;
6. starts from arm64 `defconfig` and merges the project fragments;
7. builds `Image`, the LK-compatible gzip-compressed `Image.gz`, and all arm64
   DTBs out-of-tree;
8. packages both kernel forms, the MediaTek DTBs, configuration, provenance,
   and checksums under `~/artifacts/gemini-pda/`.

The download, source, build, and artifact locations never live in the macOS
checkout. Print their exact guest paths with:

```sh
./scripts/dev-vm kernel paths
```

## Patch series

Create logical commits in a disposable development clone, then export them with
`git format-patch`. Store the resulting files below a directory named for the
baseline and list them in application order:

```text
patches/
  series
  v7.1.3/
    0001-arm64-dts-mediatek-add-gemini-pda.patch
    0002-clk-mediatek-add-required-clock.patch
```

`patches/series` would contain:

```text
v7.1.3/0001-arm64-dts-mediatek-add-gemini-pda.patch
v7.1.3/0002-clk-mediatek-add-required-clock.patch
```

Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored. Missing files, unsafe
paths, whitespace in paths, checksum failures, and patches that do not apply
cleanly stop the build before compilation.

When the series changes, the next preparation replaces only the generated,
versioned source tree. Do not make unique edits in that managed tree; author
changes in a separate Git clone and export them back into this repository.

## Kernel configuration

The manifest names an upstream base configuration and an ordered list of config
fragments. The current fragment is `configs/gemini.fragment`. Add a symbol with
the patch that requires it. Kernel `merge_config.sh` reports redundant or
overridden values, and `olddefconfig` resolves new dependencies.

The Gemini fragment also disables EFI, ACPI, virtualization/Xen, SCSI, and ATA
for this DT-only Android/LK handoff. Those host-oriented stacks are not part of
the device boot contract and keeping them out of the built-in image leaves room
under the MT6797 LK platform's fixed 50 MiB decompression buffer. This is a
Gemini packaging constraint, not an upstream arm64 default.

## Individual stages

```sh
./scripts/dev-vm kernel status
./scripts/dev-vm kernel check-latest
./scripts/dev-vm kernel prepare
./scripts/dev-vm kernel configure
./scripts/dev-vm kernel build
```

The manifest remains pinned until reviewed and changed in Git. `check-latest`
only compares it to kernel.org; it never changes build inputs automatically.

Set `BUILD_MODULES=1` inside a guest shell when modules are needed. The
resulting package contains them below `modules/lib/modules/<release>/` and
records `modules_built=true` in `provenance/build.json`. Linux 7.1.3
builds `Image.gz` as an explicit arm64 boot target; no `CONFIG_KERNEL_GZIP`
symbol is required. The package retains the uncompressed arm64 `Image` for
inspection and generic loaders, plus `Image.gz` for the retained Planet LK
handoff. The Android 8 LK source selects
its 64-bit path from `bootopt`, scans the compressed kernel payload for an
appended DTB, and calls its gzip decompressor before entering the kernel; a raw
`Image` is therefore not a valid Gemini LK kernel payload.

Validate the newest package after a build (or pass an explicit guest artifact
directory):

```sh
./scripts/dev-vm validate-kernel
```

The validator checks the complete `SHA256SUMS` manifest, required
`Image`/`Image.gz`/DTB and provenance files, and the recorded source, patchset,
and configuration hashes.
It is an integrity check only; it does not imply that the kernel boots or that
any peripheral driver works on a device.

For the retained Planet LK handoff, build the non-flashing Android v0 candidate
only through the VM wrapper documented in [DEV_VM.md](DEV_VM.md):
`experiments/2026-07-12-boot-contract-recovery/scripts/build-current-lk-candidate.sh`.
It revalidates the package, creates a byte-reproducible minimal UART initramfs,
serializes gzip+appended-DTB output, and records parser evidence. The wrapper
does not select a partition or write hardware; a successful parse is not a
runtime boot result.

Before treating the series as submission-ready, run the pinned tree's review
checker over every patch:

```sh
./scripts/dev-vm run experiments/2026-07-14-patch-quality-audit/scripts/audit-checkpatch.sh
```

This is a review gate, not a build gate. The current 77-patch audit found
ten missing sign-offs, 64 warnings, and 18 check-only diagnostics, including
new binding/driver review items in patch 0075; see the [recorded result](../experiments/2026-07-14-patch-quality-audit/results/checkpatch-current-77-20260714.txt).
The [review action plan](../experiments/2026-07-14-patch-quality-audit/results/review-action-plan-current-74-20260714.md)
separates provenance blockers from cleanup work. Do not fabricate sign-offs:
the actual contributor must provide them before submission. The companion
[provenance audit](../experiments/2026-07-14-patch-quality-audit/results/patch-provenance-current-77-20260714.txt)
also rejects placeholder authors and synthetic all-zero patch object IDs.

## Moving artifacts to the flashing machine

After reviewing the guest artifacts:

```sh
./scripts/dev-vm export-artifacts
```

This creates a timestamped, Git-ignored host directory. Verify its
`SHA256SUMS` and the provenance metadata before transferring selected files to
the separate Windows flashing machine. The normal workflow must never package
or write the preloader, NVRAM, GPT, or a whole-device image.
