# Autorate boot: no data frame acknowledged with the fixed-rate bit cleared

Result record, 2026-10-24. One boot on the `mt6797-a53-wifi-autorate`
profile: the pipelining tree plus 0242 (clear the descriptor's fixed-rate
bit for ordinary data frames so the firmware selects the rate; management
and security frames keep OFDM 6 Mbit/s). Build input `88f5edaf`, boot
`673ab08e…`, candidate `1b04c2a9…`, boot2 `08a930e8…`, admitted by the host
watcher. Same laptop and AP as the series.

## Observed

Scan, authentication, association, both EAPOL replies and both key
commands completed as on every single-arm boot: every frame with a fixed
6 Mbit/s descriptor was acknowledged (`status=0`). The data phase then
queued four ordinary frames (the leaf's DHCP discovers, 342 bytes, three
pages each) and the firmware reported each with TX status 3 after about
three seconds, the retry-limit result in the public gen3 status
enumeration, so nothing reached the access point: `tx_queued=4 tx_done=0
tx_failed=4`, DHCP never bound, no listener, no measurement. The host's
disconnect ended the data phase at 12.2 s; the teardown then completed in
full (PM abort, deauthentication delivered, an absence notice arriving
before stage 3 counted as "outside teardown" by 0243, stage 3 with credits
returned, disable `status=0`), and the device returned to changed-boot
Gemian `c977624f-203f-487f-a31e-8d0125ffe654`.

## Reading

The station record already carries the OFDM rate set and the 5 GHz PHY
type, so the firmware's selector was not starved of rates; yet every
auto-rate frame went unacknowledged while fixed-rate frames to the same
peer succeeded in the same lifetime. Clearing the bit alone is therefore
not the rate lever. The next hypothesis is the transmit parameters the
firmware derives when the station record is updated (its basic rate set,
desired PHY set and default fixed rate code, which the vendor driver
populates together), not the per-frame descriptor; that needs the vendor
driver's public station-record path read against our command before
another boot. 0242 is retired from the series with its profile; the
descriptor stays fixed at OFDM 6 Mbit/s, which the pipelining boot has
shown still leaves room up to about 3.2 Mbit/s of goodput on this host
path.
